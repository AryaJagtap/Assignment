Assignment for Internship from Batch System ( Internshala )

Click on the hovering image to get to the main page.
Then click on the Download to go to the last cover page.

I have used locofy to get the html and css structure from the provided figma template.
Then i have used chatgpt to add animations and hover effects to it.

Also i have used netlify to host the assignment(webpage) as vercel was showing some error while deployment.
